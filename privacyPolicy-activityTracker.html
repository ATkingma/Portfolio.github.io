      <p class="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong> ActivityTracker operates entirely on your device. All data is stored locally on your computer, and we never collect, transmit, or share your browsing data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>ActivityTracker collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Site patterns that you manually add to track</li>
      <li>Time spent on websites matching your saved patterns</li>
      <li>Dates and duration of visits to tracked websites</li>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
    <p>All data is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API. This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your browsing data never leaves your computer</li>
      <li>We don't use any remote servers to store your information</li>
      <li>No one else can access your activity data unless they have physical access to your device</li>
      <li>If you uninstall the extension, all tracked data is permanently deleted</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere, security risks are minimal. The extension only has access to the specific permissions granted in the installation process.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>

      <li>You can remove tracked sites at any time</li>
      <li>You can clear all stored data by uninstalling the extension</li>
